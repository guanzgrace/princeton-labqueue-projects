# Princeton Lab Queue Projects (public repo)

This repository is a reference for students who want to do IW projects benefitting the Princeton COS 126/226/217 Lab Queue. Specifically, it provides:

- Cleaned-up, anonymized data (in CSV format) of lab queue wait times from the middle of the Fall 2017 semester to the middle of the Spring 2019 semester. The data without any outliers removed is in `labqueue_anon.csv` and the data with some outliers manually removed is in `labqueue_anon_1.csv`. The process of dataset creation and documentation of the features can be found in `Projects/This_Project.pdf`. An example of reading and plotting this lab queue data can be found in `data_visualization.ipynb`.

- A basic ElasticNet model to predict student wait times in `elasticnet_model.ipynb`.

- Additional project ideas in `Projects/Project_Ideas.pdf`.
